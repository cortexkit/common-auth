   * the session): the host chains turns with `previous_response_id` by
   * diffing its own request as it was before this hook ran, so the server
   * only stays in step when every frame is rewritten the same way. Never
   * alter, drop or reorder the `input` items the host put in the frame, and

   * server holds exactly what it sent. Adding items to `input`, or adding or
   * changing settings fields, keeps the host's order and continuation when
   * done the same way for every frame: the added items become part of the
   * server's history and the follow-up turn stays incremental.
   *
   * What inserting `input` items into every frame does not keep is the
   * equivalence of the two ways a history reaches the server (settings
   * fields carry no history, so they are not affected). Incrementally, each
   * frame carries only
   * the new items, so an item the rewrite inserts into every frame lands at
   * every network boundary of the accumulated history. After a reconnect the
   * host replays the whole history in one frame, and the same rewrite
   * inserts that item once. The two server-side histories, and their cache
   * prefixes, then differ. A rewrite that only adds or changes settings
   * fields is unaffected. An adapter that inserts `input` items must show,
   * for its own insertion, that the accumulated incremental history equals
   * the rewritten full replay (including across tool loops), or accept the
   * divergence and name what it costs (a cache miss and a different prompt
   * after every reconnect).
   *
   * It runs for every frame, including one no attempt can be tied to
   * (`attempt` is then `undefined`), so the rewrite never depends on
   * attribution.
